              I have developed projects and have been a teaching assistant for
              students in the world of full-stack development. During my career
              in the world of programming I have enjoyed being self-taught, I
              have supported my educational training with bootcamps, online
              courses and I have surrounded myself with people with more
              experience where I have been able to acquire technical and
              personal skills. In the month of September 2022 I was hired by a
              company called "COSINTE LTDA" located in the Chic√≥ Norte sector,
              where I held the position of Media and Platforms Administrator
              performing functions such as: Development of the mobile
              application of the platform of said company, make configurations
              and implement new functionalities to the company's web platform
              and customer service. I held this position until February of this
              year.
